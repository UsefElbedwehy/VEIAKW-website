/**
 * Belt-and-braces fallback for the SADAD "Payment Success/Failed Return URL"
 * (set once in the SADAD merchant dashboard — SADAD's invoice API takes no
 * per-invoice callback URL, so this can't rely on a `?order=` query param the
 * way a per-invoice redirect would).
 *
 * The webhook (/api/payments/sadad-webhook) is the authoritative source of
 * truth; this only covers the case where the shopper's browser makes it back
 * but the webhook was delayed or missed. Exactly which query param SADAD
 * appends on redirect isn't nailed down in the integration doc, so this
 * defensively checks the common spellings — confirm the real one against a
 * sandbox test and adjust `PARAM_KEYS` below if needed.
 *
 * Shared by two routes so the same logic answers both the canonical
 * /api/payments/sadad-return path and whatever custom path was actually
 * pasted into the SADAD dashboard (see /[locale]/payment/sadadpay).
